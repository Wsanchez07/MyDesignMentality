            <h2 class="title">My Time At Anthem Institute</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Through my journey of honing my passions through education, I attended Anthem Institute in 2012, where I recieved my certificate in Graphic Design/Animation. It was here where I perfected basic design standards, to logo design, to mini mock up sites, while pushing the envelope on my own artistic style and skill. This was also my first introduction the entire Adobe suite. The majority of the assignments were handled with Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash - which is no more, as well as a few others. Below are a few quick screenshots of mock ups for, logo desing, magazine spreads, and mini-sites, hope you enjoy.
