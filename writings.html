                        <p class="card-description">Recently I got a little older and wiser,<br>
                            I even learned a lesson or two,<br>
                            like how loving someone could never be as poetic as I wanted it to be...<br>
                            how metaphors & similes couldn’t hold us like glue.<br>
                            <br>
                            How can I accept that the miracle of love,<br>
                            isn’t really a miracle at all?<br>
                            But rather an ambush or shove,<br>
                            followed by a trip and then the fall...<br>
                            How can I wrap myself in someone’s arms<br>
                            when I know that there isn’t any sorta poetic loving involved?<br>
                            I came here for some warmth,<br>
                            to only watch my future years with you dissolve.<br>
                            <br>
                            How do I unlearn the romantic thoughts<br>
                            that came in heavy and weighed a ton?<br>
                            They taught me about the butterflies<br>
                            and the fireworks,<br>
                            but never how to load the gun...<br>
                            <br>
                            So, I’ve accepted that the story we were writing was fiction,<br>
                            Something like “The Tell-Tale Heart”.<br>
                            I don’t need someone to see me as a chore, but rather an addiction,<br>
                            Someone who’d see the poetry in me,<br>
                            even in the dark.<br>

                            You are a storm, an environmental entity<br>
                            only here to destroy, disturb and deteriorate<br>
                            the CEO of the skies, you are hated, yet adored<br>
                            you are cursed in the mornings, but praised at night<br>
                            when alone souls who dwell on misery<br>
                            can no longer put up a fight,<br>
                            your pressure comes in high, seeking those that are low<br>
                            to engulf them completely, so their anguish and disdain can grow...<br>
                            <br>
                            you see.. you, you are beautiful!<br>
                            you're massive fields of blankets of snow<br>
                            to daunting to look at, cuz babyboy you glow<br>
                            still and complacent, seeking nowhere to go<br>
                            covering you completely, with a blanket like caress<br>
                            seeking me during summer, because you miss my finesse…<br>
                            Babyboy you are rains, capable of baptizing cities,<br>
                            and quick sanding fields…<br>
                            I’m coming, full blast, full force, no shield..<br>
                            purifying you, blessing you, reviving you<br>
                            for another day…<br>
                            <br>
                            flooding your thoughts, wondering what you’ll get<br>
                            invading your dreams, no wonder they’re wet…<br>
                            but just like rain the next morning you evaporate…<br>
                            I was only important for one night,<br>
                            knocking on your window just so you can sleep right…<br>
                            the sun rises and hides the stars, you no longer need me again…<br>
                            so I pack my winds, gather my clouds, and attempt to leave<br>
                            but only after I leave everything at a sog,<br>
                            watchin you from above as you now complain of fog…<br>
                            but see..<br>
                            that was a gift too, like a pearl, from an oyster<br>
                            you wouldn't understand, how your skin needs my moisture<br>
                            boy, you are hail, so this should be no surprise<br>
                            that my aim wont fail, as I get bigger in size….<br>
                            <br>
                            you've taken all of my good, but none of my bad<br>
                            you used me up like the summer<br>
                            the size of a softball, but I got you to yield,<br>
                            <br>
                            here comes karma ready to make you suffer…<br>
                            you see me flying down headed for your windshield,<br>
                            aint this a bummer,<br>
                            now you wanna find the beauty in this minefield,<br>
                            but watch where you step you runner…<br>
                            you are a storm, they awe at your magic<br>
                            but hate you so much when you cause state wide tragic<br>
                            they pack up and drift, searching for a safe haven to find,<br>
                            now you call and speak of the weather, and the perilous times,<br>
                            completely oblivious and narcissistically blind.<br>

                            I'm the son of a women who told me my name was an earthquake in waiting. Not everyone was going to understand and comprehend or let alone pronounce it correctly. She said, hold it in your mouth like the most dangerous secret this world has yet to find out about. Carry it to the mountain tops, until its time to scream.
                        </p>

                            I’m the son of a man who told me every eye was going to be on me.  That my downfall was preyed upon and was expected.  I was not to be anything more than the common disappointment.  He said, take my path of destruction and hustle, and intertwine it with the path of knowledge. With those things together, you are indestructible.

                            I'm only 5'7 on a really good day, but being built like a short story is a lesson in finding other ways to be the tallest tale in the room. You may not see me at first, but you’re here for me without even knowing. I’ve danced around your gates for some time, its time for you to let me in!
