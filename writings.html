                                    Recently I got a little older and wiser,<br>
                                    I even learned a lesson or two,<br>
                                    like how loving someone could never be as poetic as I wanted it to be...<br>
                                    how metaphors & similes couldn’t hold us like glue.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How can I accept that the miracle of love,<br>
                                    isn’t really a miracle at all?<br>
                                    But rather an ambush or shove,<br>
                                    followed by a trip and then the fall...<br>
                                    How can I wrap myself in someone’s arms<br>
                                    when I know that there isn’t any sorta poetic loving involved?<br>
                                    I came here for some warmth,<br>
                                    to only watch my future years with you dissolve.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How do I unlearn the romantic thoughts<br>
                                    that came in heavy and weighed a ton?<br>
                                    They taught me about the butterflies<br>
                                    and the fireworks,<br>
                                    but never how to load the gun...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, I’ve accepted that the story we were writing was fiction,<br>
                                    Something like “The Tell-Tale Heart”.<br>
                                    I don’t need someone to see me as a chore, but rather an addiction,<br>
                                    Someone who’d see the poetry in me,<br>
                                    even in the dark.<br>

                                    make such an impact<br>
                                    bigger than the big bang itself?<br>

                                    What once was the biggest star,<br>

                                    That warms my entire celestial system<br>
                                    My new sun comes in the form of a person…<br>
                                    so here we have a vast universe,<br>
                                    with millions of galaxies<br>
                                    and thousands of planets<br>
                                    and then... you...<br>
                                    in the form of flesh…<br>
                                    <br>
                                    the beauty of the celestial skies<br>
                                    can’t compare to your rugged,<br>
                                    statuesque, presence your being<br>
                                    has imprinted on my heart,<br>
                                    I could run around Saturn’s rings<br>
                                    or fight through Jupiter’s big red storm<br>
                                    but nothing can open your eyes.<br>
                                    You’re the Sun, I’m like Pluto, meaning<br>
                                    rarely ever do I get heat from you.<br>
                                    The furthest thing in distance<br>
                                    How could I expect my existence,<br>
                                    To reach, and break through…<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But ever so often,<br>
                                    There’s a glimpse of warmth,<br>
                                    As you’ve finally gazed my way,<br>
                                    And as quick as I’ve given up before<br>
                                    Today is a new day..<br>
                                    So, I’ll circle around you again,<br>
                                    And hope that today is different.<br>
                                    Not that I want to annoy you<br>
                                    But I like to remain vigilant…<br>
                                    <br>
                                    They say persistency is key,<br>
                                    So I don’t really plan on going away,<br>
                                    I’ll continue to admire your fiery seas,<br>
                                    Until we collide in our own Milky Way….<br>
                                    Maybe on that day,<br>
                                    we’ll finally live in the divine,<br>
                                    for every day I get down and pray<br>
                                    for our planets to align.

She said, hold it in your mouth like the most dangerous secret this world has yet to find out about. Carry it to the mountain tops, until its time to scream.

I was not to be anything more than the common disappointment.  He said, take my path of destruction and hustle, and intertwine it with the path of knowledge. With those things together, you are indestructible.

You may not see me at first, but you’re here for me without even knowing. I’ve danced around your gates for some time, its time for you to let me in!
