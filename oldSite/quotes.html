   <p>Fauset was the first African American woman elected to a state legislature in the country, <br />chosen in 1938 to represent the 18th District of Philadelphia, which was over 66 percent white. <br />She introduced legislation that addressed public health, low-income housing and women's workplace rights.

   <h3>"We should not want to think of America as a 'melting pot', <br />but as a great interracial-laboratory where Americans can really begin to build the <br />thing which the rest of the world feels that they stand for today, and that is real democracy."</h3></p>

<h1>James Forten - Businessman</h1>
<img src="img/James Forten.jxr" width="200" />
<p>September 2, 1766 - March 4, 1842</p>
    

    <p>A sailmaker with a bustling business that employed both black and white workers, <br />Forten was one of the wealthiest Philadelphians of his time, of any race. He used his position and his fortune <br />to fight slavery, and to demand civil rights for African Americans, successfully leading the fight against a Pennsylvania bill <br />that would have required new black residents to register with the state.</p>
    
    <h3>"Has the God who made the white man and the black left any record <br />declaring us a different species?... Are we not sustained by <br />the same power, supported by the same food and should we not then enjoy the same liberty?"</h3>

    <h1>Octavius V. Catto - Civil Rights Activist</h1>
    <img src="img/Octavius V Catto.jpg" width="200" />
    <p>February 22, 1893 - October 10, 1871</p>
    
   
    <p>Octavius Catto was the greatest civil rights leader in post-Civil War Philly. Catto was an educator, <br />athlete, and major in the Pennsylvania National Guard, who recruited African Americans to serve in the military. <br />He was assassinated on election day in 1871, as black faught for the right to vote.</p>
    <h3>"We shall never rest at ease, but will agitate and work, by our means and our influence, <br />in court and out of court, asking aid of the press, calling upon Christians to vindicate their Christianity, <br />and the members of the law to assert the principles of the profession by <br />granting us justice and right, until these invidious and unjust usages shall have ceased."</h3>

    <h1>Frances Ellen Watkins Harper - Writer</h1>
    <img src="img/Frances Ellen Watkins Harper.jpg" width="200" />
    <p>September 24, 1825 - February 22, 1911</p>
    
    
    <p>Harper was a writer, abolitionist suffragette, was born free in 1825, and spent most of her adult life in Philadelphia, <br />where she was active with the Underground Railroad. She published over 11 books of poetry and fiction,<br /> icluding lola Leroy, one of the first novels published by an African American. Her writings primarily focused on social issues,<br /> education for women, temperance and responsibility.</p>
    <h4><p>From "Bury Me In A Free Land" Harper's most famous poem:</p></h4>
       <h3> <p>"Make me a grave where'er you will, in a lowly plain, or a lofty hill <br />
        Make it among Earth's humblest graves, but not in a land where men are slaves."</p></h3>

    <h1>Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander - Lawyer</h1>
    <img src="img/Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.jpg" width="200" />
    <p>January 2, 1898 - November 1, 1989</p>
    
   
    <p>The first black female lawyer in Pennsylvania, Sadie Alexander was Philly's assistant city solicitor <br />at a time - the 1930's - when few women of any race held city titles. As a young woman, <br />Sadie knew that education was the key to success. She was the first black woman to graduate from Penn Law <br />and the first in the nation to get a Ph.D. in economics.</p>
    <h3>"I never looked for anybody to hold  the door open for me, <br />I knew well that the only way I could get that door open was to knock it down: becuase I knocked all of them down."</h3>
