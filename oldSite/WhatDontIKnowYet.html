    <h1>"WHAT DON'T I KNOW YET?"</h1>

  
    <p>Im not too confident on anything involving UX and Agile, I feel like in those moments where there was a book involved, I sort of just coasted along to get by without ever really trying. Becuase we dont really do any testing it has allowed me skate by, even though I'll only be hindering myself in the long run. I also want another go round on tables</p>
        
        
        
    <h1>"WHAT COULD I BE DOING WITH MY SPARE TIME?"</h1>

    <p>The perfect answer is "Reading" becuase it's what I SHOULD be doing, however the only time I would have to catch up on reading would be the weekends. In regards to my personal life, I still have to do my taxes, I have to begin prepping for my trip to Brazil in April, and I have to look into domain names for trademark purposes, once thats done I can begin wireframing it. </p>



    <h1>WHATS ON MY "TO DO LIST"</h1>

        <li>Password Application Forms Mock Up</li>
        <li>Entering the helmets into my superbowl Sunday page</li>

        <li>I have to look into my credit score, got a not so good email the other day</li>
        <li>Cop</li>
      </ul>
